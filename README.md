# RevenueCat Frontend Interviews

Hello ðŸ‘‹!

Welcome to our Frontend interview. This repository aims to provide you with a starting point to setup your environment. Feel free to clone it ahead of the interview, and make sure that:

- Git works, you can commit, and push easily.
- The test runner work, and you can easily write new tests.
- The development environment works, with hot reloading.

When the interview starts, you will be given access to the instructions, but as a hint, it will be a real world exercise consisting on consuming a real backend API and doing some data manipulations. So make sure to have those concepts fresh!

The interview will be focused on JavaScript / TypeScript, React and Styling fundamentals. You can use your editor of choice, and will be sharing your screen throughout the interview.
